      <p>
        I slit open my wrists,<br />
        And all that pours out is your name.<br />
        I put it to my lips,<br />
        And have a mouthful of your taste.<br /><br />
        I bleed a river and I don't stop.<br />
        I drown myself on the shore.<br />
        My love is dark, my love is haunting.<br />
        My love is violence, my love is gore.<br /><br />
        You are the darkness surrounding my heart.<br />
        You are the scars on my soul.<br />
        The part and parcel of my aura,<br />
        You graze me and make me whole.<br />
