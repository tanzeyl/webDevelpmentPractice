        I love you.<br />
        Like the moon loves to twinkle,<br />
        And a river loves to flow.<br />
        I love you.<br />
        Like a bird loves to sing.<br />
        And the sun loves to glow.<br />
        I love you.<br />
        Like a pirate loves to sail.<br />
        And the sea loves to shatter.<br />
        I love you.<br />
        Like a flower loves to bloom.<br />
        And the rain loves to pitter-patter.<br />
        I love you.<br />
        Like a monk who loves to pray.<br />
        And God loves to slay.<br />
        I love you.<br />
        Like the time loves to end.<br />
        And a rainbow loves to bend.<br />
        I love you.<br />
        Like a candle loves to shine.<br />
        And fingers loves to intertwine.<br />
        I love you.<br />
        Like a superhero loves his cloak.<br />
        And we love to smoke.<br />
