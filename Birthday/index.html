      <p>
        I don't know when or how I fell for you. All I can say for certainty is
        that the moment I realized I have fallen for you, I have been falling
        ever since. You truly are "the bane of my existence and the object of
        all my desires".<br /><br />
        I am a selfish human. You must have noticed it from the way I treat my
        friends. I do not want to comfort others. I do not want to be a shoulder
        they cry on. But for you, I'd drown a million times if the water has
        your scent, I'd climb endlessly if the peak echoes your voice, I'd kill
        without a thought, if a sinner is what you sought.<br /><br />
        I yearn for you when we are apart. My soul is rejoiced when you lie next
        to me. Every day, I hold you in my arms and every day, my heart flutters
        with excitement when I pull you close. Every day, my lips tremble when
        they are about to touch yours and every day, I lean in nonetheless, just
        to taste you. You make me feel happy. Whenever you are around, I feel
        like someone took me out of a void, placed me gently on your palms and
        you wrapped my whole body with your hands. You make me giggle and laugh.
        For you, I act silly and foolish. I can never thank you enough for
        making me feel all of this for the first time.<br /><br />
        If I could, I'd offer you the entire universe with all of its beauty,
        but I am no God. As a mere human, the best I can offer you is my
        never-ending love and a bond so pure and divine that if materialized, it
        would make gardens bloom. As a mere human, the best I can offer you is a
        promise. A promise to never let go of your hand. No matter what, even if
        somehow the entire world is against you, I promise that I will be by
        your side and in your service, I shall burn down every atom that dares
        to speak against you. As a mere human, the best I can offer you is my
        heart. It is dark and hard to love, but it is yours to protect and yours
        and yours to shatter.<br /><br />
        A very happy and warm birthday to you, my love. I wish that you achieve
        everything that you want from this life and more. I know how many
        sacrifices you have made and continue to make for others, I just want to
        see it all pay-off someday. I am in tears right now and it is getting
        hard to type, so before ending this, I want to tell you something
        random. I love how much we both need each other. I have never been
        needed by someone, so, thank you, for needing me.
